## Unisys - MS CWS Prototype
# Technical Approach *(2)*

Our team utilized an “*outside-in*” product development approach to create our MS CWS prototype. “*Outside-in*” focuses on the end user’s needs and experience to drive features, along with supporting application program interfaces (API). Focusing on the end user means that their needs are implemented pervasively throughout the application. This practice promotes user satisfaction and adoption through continuous interaction/feedback.  Our team utilized the following approach for this prototype:

* Conducted user research to understand needs and trends within related industry. Our User Researcher conducted user interviews with a current Case Worker, along with staff members acting as the identified personas (parent/guardian) to create the initial application concept (2c).
* Created initial UI documented as wireframes (Balsamiq) which were presented to staff members representing the personas associated with the system. Feedback was incorporated into an updated UI design (InVision) (2g).
* Identified user stories to form initial product backlog. 
* Developed fully interactive prototype web/mobile application. The initial prototype was presented to the representative user base from the user research phase. The findings from users interacting with the application, such as usability improvements, were incorporated into the final design (2g).
* Developed fully functioning prototype including back end API for data persistence as a series of “*vertical slices*” allowing testing throughout the effort.

The “*outside-in*” product development approach [incorporates the application development aspects of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook ](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Adherence-to-U.S.-Digital-Services-Playbook). 


## Architecture

Our architecture is based on JavaScript (Angular.js) with a Java API (Dropwizard) and PostgreSQL database.

# Adherence to U.S. Digital Services Playbook *(2)*

We followed all of the applicable Playbook plays. [Details here](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Adherence-to-U.S.-Digital-Services-Playbook).

# Understanding of User Needs*(2c)*
We employed Human-Centered Design (HCD) to elicit user requirements to form the Product Backlog. The section below summarizes our HCD process for the prototype. [Details here](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Human-Centered-Design-Process)

## Human-Centered Design *(2d)*

[Our HCD process](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/Human-Centered-Design-Process) leveraged the following techniques:

### Inspiration

* Developed **Design Challenge**: "*As a caseworker or parent, I would like to search for child care providers in my vicinity so that I can choose the best provider for a child*"
* Conducted 1:1 and Group Interviews with real case worker and several non-participating staff
* Conducted user research to identify target audiences
* Developed personas
* Brainstormed, starting with "_Diverge_" step to get all ideas (no concern for viability/feasibility), then "_Converged_" to reduce ideas list to only viable/feasible.

### Ideation
* Synthesized insights from users (wants):
	* Simple / Intuitive
	* Trustworthy
	* Case worker / children photos
	* Print time-stamped case worker conversations  
* Created [user stories](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/tree/master/stories)
	* [Child Care Provider Basic Search](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Child-Care-Provider-Basic-Search)
	* [Child Care Provider Advanced Search](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Child-Care-Provider-Advanced-Search)
	* [Child Care Provider Map Search](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Child-Care-Provider-Map-Search)
	* [Schedule Service Provider Appointment](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Schedule-Service-Provider-Appointment)
	* [Email or Call Child Care Provider](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Email-or-Call-Child-Care-Provider)
	* [Multi-Language](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Multi-Language)
	* [Understanding Quality Star Ratings](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Understanding-Quality-Star-Ratings)
	* [Filtering and Sorting Search Results](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Filtering-and-Sorting-Search-Results)
	* [Provider Details Page](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal/wiki/User-Story:-Provider-Details-Page)
* Brainstormed designs during internal & user [whiteboard sessions](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal-documentation/tree/master/whiteboard) *(2c)*
* Updated user stories elaborations, including acceptance criteria *(2g)*

### Implementation
* Developed [Balsamiq low-fi wireframes](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal-documentation/tree/master/wireframes) - using whiteboard designs & feedback from internal / user testing *(2g)*
* Conducted user tests and gathered feedback *(2f)*
* Developed [PhotoShop/InVision high-fi web mockup prototype](https://github.com/mscws/cws-caseworker-parent-portal-documentation/tree/master/hi-fi-mockups) - using wireframes / user testing feedback *(2g)*
* Conducted mockup prototype user tests; gathered feedback *(2f)*
* Developed live [Design Style Guide (DSG)](https://parentportal.tabordasolutions.net/guidelines.html) using bootstrap/SASS/CSS/HTML. DSG elements leveraged HTML mockup / user testing feedback. *(2g)*
* Conducted responsive design testing on desktop (Mac, PC) and mobile devices (iOS, Android) *(2h)*
* Updated DSG Design elements as prototype was elaborated – keeping DSG and prototype pages consistent and synchronized *(2e)*
* Developed prototype HTML using HTML mockup, user testing feedback, and DSG
* Iterated on pages, incorporating user testing feedback between iterations, finally reaching minimal viable product (MVP) *(2g)*
